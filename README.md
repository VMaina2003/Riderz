##  How It Works

1. **Customer** creates an order using a simple form.
2. **Admin** assigns a rider to the order.
3. **Rider** accepts the order and starts the delivery.
4. **Customer** can **track the rider live** until delivery is complete.
5. **Admin** monitors all deliveries from the dashboard.
